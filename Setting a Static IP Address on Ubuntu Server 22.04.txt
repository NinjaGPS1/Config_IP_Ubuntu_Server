========Note=====
+[eth0]: is the name of my network interface - yours may differ.
+Under [addresses:] is the static IP to set, youâ€™ll need to use CIDR notation, so [/24] is [255.255.255.0.]
+DNS servers are configured under [nameservers:] multiple servers should be command separated.
+The default gateway is set under [routes:] and [- to: default.]
